# Types of Ruin Sites

The table below offers suggestions as to what kind of structure the exploration site might be. An initial d6 roll gives a general type of structure that you can use as grist for your inspiration, while an additional d12 can be rolled to get a specific example.

Some of the listed sites might not make sense in a particular context. While you can always just re-roll or pick something, it can sometimes be interesting to read the result metaphorically, and then put a structure in that matches the essential significance of the rolled result.

# Room Layout and Map Features

## Setting up the Initial Room

To begin, pick a room as an **ingress point** - the place where the heroes will enter the site. There may be other places to get into the structure, but this is the most obvious. Place this room's index card on the table in front of you.

Then roll on the adjacent exit table to find out how many egresses exist. You might arbitrarily decide to give two or more exits to this initial room so the PCs have some decisions to make as to where to explore.

## Building the Map

1. **Roll for Direction**: For each exit, roll on the egresses table to see what direction it runs in. If the direction is impossible, such as heading west out of a room you know is on the western edge of a structure, then flip it in the opposite direction.

2. **Mark Exits**: Take a coin or other temporary marker and put it on the index card to indicate the egress' location.

3. **Add Adjacent Rooms**: For each egress, place a room's index card adjacent in the matching direction, gradually building out the site as you continue to roll exits and egresses for each.

4. **Handle Dead Ends**: If a room only has one exit, then it's a dead end. If the egresses fold back on the map to create a new link with an existing room, place a marker accordingly between the two cards. Keep adding cards and rolling for exits until you run out of room cards for your site.

## Finalizing the Map

Next, go through the map you've generated and clean up the connections:
- Remove excess connections between rooms 
- Bend long strings of rooms back toward the center of the structure
- Try to ensure that at least one "loop" of rooms exists, so the entire site isn't just a clump of mutually-segregated linear arms

Lastly, sketch an outline of each room's dimensions on the index card. If there's a fight there, you'll need to know the room's shape and size to run the hostilities.

At this stage, it's possible to stock this map exactly as it is. You can copy its configuration down in your notes and then go on to add room contents to each of the index cards, with notes on the margins about exits and where they lead. If you want to add further spice to the site, you can go on to add some map layout features before you do this, however.

## Map Features

At its simplest, a map layout feature is just some quirk about the site's geography that affects multiple rooms that the PCs cannot readily ignore. As examples, here are some options you can add:

### Different Levels
Some rooms will have stairs or slopes up or down, and the cluster of rooms beyond this point will be at a higher or lower elevation. Traditionally, the lower levels of a Deep tend to contain the worst abominations and most fearsome monsters.

### Rivers or Streams
Flow through some sites, cutting off rooms on either side in the absence of a bridge or a party of brave swimmers. Monstrous life forms like to live in such rivers, and falling in might result in more conventional perils of drowning.

### Crevasses and Pits
Bisect some sites or have opened up in some rooms. Those who climb down might gain access to a whole new level of the site, or there might be creatures that travel up and down the cleft to reach their lairs or hunting grounds.

### Toxic Atmospheres
Common in arratus and other xenoformed areas. They may not be poisonous enough to kill a human outright, but lingering in such places usually increases System Strain until the humans must flee or pass out. A mild arratu might just prevent humans from recovering System Strain while inside it, while an alien xenoforming structure might inflict a point of strain every hour. The right protective enchantments or devices might be needed to make exploration possible at all.

### Timed Accessibility
Exists in some sites, with particular areas only being accessible at particular times. They might be behind ancient time-locked doors, or the vast swarm of man-eating vermin that blocks the only ingress into the sub-zone might go out to hunt during the day. Sometimes accessibility is predicated on having particular key objects or succeeding in an Investigation challenge to learn the proper methods to open a sealed portal.

## Corridors and Detailed Maps

The maps you create with this technique are simple diagram maps, ones that focus on points of interest and handwave the corridors or tunnels between the rooms. When the party goes north out of the armory, they arrive outside the south door of the grand dining hall; the space between is unimportant.

This doesn't mean you don't need to give it even a little thought, however. If the PCs get jumped by a wandering encounter on their way between rooms you may need to improvise a section of corridor for the fight. Conversely, if the site is a single small building, there may not be any meaningful corridors between rooms, and loud activities in the armory will be clearly audible to whatever's dwelling in the grand dining hall.

GMs for groups that prefer more concrete sites can always plunder one of the myriad dungeon maps available online, re-keying rooms to fit their needs and cutting out sections that are surplus to requirements.

# Stocking Rooms

Stocking an exploration site's rooms is the most demanding part of site preparation. A ruin map can be scrawled out in moments, and deciding or randomly generating a room's purpose can take only a few minutes, but giving each such place a degree of flavor and interest is a much more challenging prospect. Fortunately, a basic system can smooth this creative work.

## Rolling For Contents

First, roll 1d8 and 1d6 together and consult the adjacent table. The 1d8 will determine what's in the room; a creature, a dangerous hazard, a peculiar enigma, or a bit of distracting background flavor. About a quarter of the rooms will be entirely empty and devoid of anything worth interacting with.

The 1d6 will then indicate whether or not there's any treasure or objects of value in the room. Thus, if the 1d8 is 6 and the 1d6 is 2, you can see that there's a distractor in the room but no treasure.

It's not impossible that a creature could share the same room as a hazard, or there might be an enigma with some distractors scattered about, but if you don't want to hand-decide such instances you can go back and re-roll the 1d8 on a selection of rooms to get a second contents result.

### Room Contents Table

| d8  | Contents   | d6  | Treasure? |
|-----|------------|-----|-----------|
| 1-2 | Creature   | 1-3 | Yes       |
|     |            | 4-6 | No        |
| 3   | Hazard     | 1-2 | Yes       |
|     |            | 3-6 | No        |
| 4   | Enigma     | 1-2 | Yes       |
|     |            | 3-6 | No        |
| 5-6 | Distractor | 1   | Yes       |
|     |            | 2-6 | No        |
| 7-8 | Empty      | 1   | Yes       |
|     |            | 2-6 | No        |

## Placing Contents

### Placing Creatures

If you get a creature result, place one or more of them into the room, using the inhabitants results from page 240 to guide your selection. Remember to make about a quarter or a third of the creatures inside the site unrelated to these rolls so there's some variety in the inhabitants.

If the inhabitants are living in the site, make sure there are locations designated for sleeping, cooking, latrines, and other necessities of daily life. The creatures may not be present there all the time, but the evidence of their activities should be obvious.

As for how numerous and strong the creatures should be, keep in mind the logic of the site and the needs of your upcoming session. A random minor ruin in the woods is unlikely to be housing a bandit army or a vengeful arch-wraith, and if you are intentionally creating a ruin to engage a party of novice adventurers the inhabitants shouldn't be so strong as to kill them out of hand unless there's a good reason for them to be so. You have flexibility on this count, so long as you don't contradict what your world has already established; if the PCs have learned that the Tower of Iron and Salt is the lair of a devil-god, make sure there's either a devil-god in it or a clear reason for people to think that there is.

### Placing Hazards

Hazards can take the form of traditional pit traps and poisoned needles, or they might be unstable construction, dangerous miasmas, or anything else that could cause harm to PCs in the area. Most traps or snares should allow an appropriate saving throw to avoid the worst results. Poison needles or toxic clouds might inflict flat damage on a failed save, and crumbling floors might send the PCs careening into a new area entirely.

### Placing Enigmas

Enigmas are any magical or mechanical oddity that might be appropriate to the site's nature. An abandoned manor in the wilderness is unlikely to have ancient megastructural power conduits flaring in its basement, but it might have a relic of the past owner's arcane experimentations or an eerie trophy taken in some former age.

An enigma result is an excuse for you to put something odd in the place, something that could perhaps help as much as harm. Complex or esoteric enigmas might take their own Investigation challenge to make them operational, with clues scattered elsewhere in the site.

### Placing Distractors

Distractors are just objects or situations that the PCs can interact with and investigate, even if there's nothing particularly important about them. Use them to flavor the site and emphasize its past use and current activities.

Whatever you use for a distractor should be something the PCs can touch or otherwise interact with. Mere backstory is not a distractor; it doesn't matter what happened in a given room unless it's something that left a tangible legacy behind for the PCs to meddle with.

### Placing Treasure

Once you know how many rooms in the site have treasure in them, take the total site loot you've already determined and divide it into halves. Put half the treasure into one or two major troves in appropriate locations in the site. Divide the other half of the loot among the other treasure-positive rooms, putting trifling finds in some and bigger hauls in others. You can play with these proportions as your own judgment recommends, but make sure that not all treasure requires a fight to get it.
