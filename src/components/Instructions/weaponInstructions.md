# Magical Weapons

A lust for enchanted steel is a commonplace among warriors, and the sorcerers of the Latter Earth have not been remiss in creating wondrous weapons for their allies and patrons. Despite the inevitable losses to time, wear, and obscurity, magical weapons from countless prior ages can still be found in ruins, strongholds, and the grip of powerful warriors.

As with any magical item, GMs should remember that the weapon’s current possessor will almost certainly be using it against their foes if they are able to do so.

## Creating Magical Weapons

First, decide whether the weapon should be a minor, major, or great treasure. An heirloom axe of a minor knightly family might seem to be appropriate for a minor weapon, while the famed war-sword of a legendary hero is probably a great treasure. This is not a certainty; even a famous blade might actually be of relatively modest power, and a little-known spear might be a relic from a forgotten legend, but it’s a good starting point for creating the weapon.

Next, roll a d20 or pick from the table below to find out the weapon’s basic enchantment bonus. This bonus is added to any hit rolls, damage rolls, and Shock the weapon might do. While most magical weapons are considered masterworks of their type, the usual masterwork bonus does not stack with these enchantments.

### Weapon Enchantment Bonus

| Bonus | Minor | Major | Great |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| +1    | 1–16  | 1–5   | 1     |
| +2    | 17–19 | 6–17  | 2–4   |
| +3    | 20    | 18–20 | 5–20  |

Once you know the enchantment bonus, you should think about the original intended users of the weapon. Who was this magical item made for? What sort of weapons did they use, and in what context were they employed? A footman in some ancient sorcerer-king’s army is going to have a very different kind of short sword than the casual sidearm carried by a noble of some vanished empire.

The adjacent table offers some suggestions as to who the original users might’ve been. If you’ve established a particular ancient empire in your campaign setting, you might credit the weapon to them, and use some recurring motifs of material, shape, or style to help emphasize the item’s origins. If the weapon was instead made by some modern mage, it might include a maker’s mark or other characteristic trait that could connect it to other items crafted by the wizard.

Each table entry provides some suggestions as to the types of weapons most likely for such a wielder. These favored weapons will form the bulk of the magical wargear found for them, though it could be that the item was a novelty created for an owner’s special purpose.

### d8: The Original Intended Users of the Weapon

| d8 | Intended User | Weapon Types |
|----|---------------|-------------|
| 1  | Used by a common member of a mass infantry unit that relied on muscle-powered weapons. | Favors spears, pole arms, short swords, or daggers. |
| 2  | Used by a civilian gentleman or duelist. | Favors swords, daggers, hand hurlants, staffs, cane-clubs, or concealable weapons. |
| 3  | Used by a champion or heroic warrior. | Favors complex, exotic, or specialist weapons, two-handed weapons, and hurlants. |
| 4  | Used by an assassin or other denied obvious weaponry. | Favors daggers, claw blades, and other small concealed weapons; sometimes long hurlants or crossbows. |
| 5  | Used by knightly duelists or other heavy-armor combatants. | Favors maces, hammers, two-handed weapons, stilettos, and other weapons with penetrating Shock. |
| 6  | Used by archers or ranged combatants. | Favors bows, crossbows, hurlants, light spears, short swords, or daggers. |
| 7  | Used by individualistic warbands. | Favors spears and short swords somewhat, but an individual warrior could use anything. |
| 8  | Used by a high-tech culture. | Roll again, but replace bows and crossbows with hurlants, and melee weapons will have advanced-tech stylings. |

Use the favored weapon suggestions as guidelines for picking the precise type of weapon the artifact might be. For additional help, you can roll on the adjacent table. If the result is a “favored primary” weapon, then pick one of the favored weapons listed above that would make sense for a main armament. “Favored secondary” are usually short swords, daggers, hand hurlants, or other backup gear appropriate to the user type. “Favored ranged” is usually a dagger, hand hurlant, light throwing spear, or other secondary ranged weapon, though archers and gunners might prefer heavier weaponry.

The tables lean towards certain weapons that have always been common and favored throughout martial history: spears and short swords. Sorcerers who built weapons for massed bodies of troops will have favored such effective, versatile weapons. Still, the very individualistic nature of most heroic warriors and the unique tastes of prior ages can sometimes result in rather unusual weapon choices. Warriors who find such equipment must sometimes put aside more familiar gear if they mean to master their newfound treasure.

Once you have the weapon enchantment, origin, and weapon type decided, you’ll want to decide whether or not the weapon might have one or more special abilities. A full list of these abilities is found on the following pages, though you can always make up more of your own or loot them from other old-school compatible games. If you haven’t any particular firm feelings about the topic, you can roll on the table below to find out.

### Special Weapon Abilities

| d12 | Minor | Major | Great |
|-----|-------|-------|-------|
| 1–2 | None  | None  | None  |
| 3–4 | None  | None  | One   |
| 5–6 | None  | One   | Two   |
| 7   | None  | One   | Two   |
| 8   | None  | One   | Two   |
| 9   | One   | Two   | Three |
| 10  | One   | Two   | Three |
| 11  | One   | Two   | Three |
| 12  | Two   | Three | Three |

With that set, your magical weapon is complete. You might give it some details of appearance and style to set it off, but don’t worry about attaching a backstory or other elaborate history to it unless you expect it to become pertinent to your game.
