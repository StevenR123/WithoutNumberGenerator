# Magical Armor and Shields

Just as sorcerers have always found use in enchanting the weapons of allied warriors, magical armor is by no means unknown in the lands of the Latter Earth. Some of these suits are simply better than their mundane equivalents, while others have certain special benefits unique to their particular enchantments.

## Armor and Shield Benefits

A suit of armor's enchantment is measured from +1 to +3. This bonus is added to the armor's base AC; thus, a war shirt +3 would grant an effective AC of 14 to the wearer. Magical armor is almost always masterwork quality, so its effective Encumbrance is one point less than that of the base version, albeit not for purposes of the Armored Magic Focus' limits. Most suits of magical armor are designed to be adjustable to most humanoid wearers.

Magical shields do not have enchantment bonuses that add to the user's Armor Class. Instead, they're empowered with unique abilities or benefits that apply to the bearer. Magical shields cannot be ruined with the Shatter Shield combat maneuver mentioned on page 44, though they can be destroyed by intentional abuse.

## Ancient Panoplies

The ancient cultures of the Latter Earth often had very exotic ideas about what armor should look like, either due to very different conditions of warfare or their ubiquitous access to magical materials. These ancient suits of armor might appear as ceremonial robes, harnesses of glass or crystalline mineral, baroquely impractical plate armors, or enchanted ornaments that cover hardly a handspan of the wearer's skin. Despite these various appearances, these ancient armors have the same statistics as the modern armors they emulate, including Encumbrance and skill check penalties. Thus, a multicolored and brocaded robe that functions as a suit of plate armor would have an Encumbrance value of 2 and apply its penalty to Sneak and Exert skill checks.

Some regions of the modern Latter Earth have preserved the techniques for fashioning armors of this kind, or have so many surviving suits that they are in common use among adventurers. Others make a point of dressing their elite guards or temple defenders in appropriate panoplies to better show their status. The presence or absence of such armor in a campaign is up to the tastes of the GM and the table; some groups love the pulp aesthetic of fur loincloths and scaled bikinis, while others prefer to rely on unisex cuirasses and rust-smelling chain hauberks.

Ancient panoplies come in both normal and enchanted versions, just like any other suit of armor. Where such armor is commonplace, normal versions cost no more than their mundane equivalents and artisans can craft them out of commonly-available components.

## Creating Magical Armor

When you need to place a suit of magical armor, first decide whether it is a minor, major, or great artifact. The context will usually determine just how potent a relic you want to place, though sometimes a seemingly minor item might turn out to be unexpectedly powerful. Once you've chosen the general category, roll a d20 to find out the armor's enchantment bonus, and again to find out whether it has some special power. Magical shields never have an enchantment bonus, but always have one special power.

Lastly, roll to see what base type of armor or shield it is, assuming you don't have a particular type in mind.

Some special abilities might grant bonuses to skills or other numeric benefits. These bonuses don't stack with other armor or weapon powers that boost similar scores; only the best bonus is applied. In the same vein, a shield and a suit of armor that both have the same ability benefit the user only once; an Impervious shield and suit of armor only allow one instance of Shock to be ignored each round rather than two.

## Armor and Shield Abilities

Below are merely a few of the special abilities that might be found on magical armor and shields. Other graces can be added, but should generally revolve around protective and utility functions rather than offensive magical effects.

**Augmented:** The bearer can carry four more points of Readied encumbrance. Once per scene, they can lift or briefly manipulate with brute strength anything a human possibly could.

**Bracing:** As a Move Action, the bearer can brace against one specific foe. Until they voluntarily move from their location, they're immune to Shock from that foe and cannot be forcibly moved.

**Clotting:** Once per day, it automatically stabilizes a Mortally Wounded bearer.

**Feathery:** The user is immune to falling damage and can choose a landing site within 30 feet of their target.

**Feral:** At the cost of one System Strain, the bearer can talk to animals for a scene, who will reply with human intellect but bestial interests and focus.

**Fireproof:** The bearer ignores the first 10 points of fire or heat damage they suffer each round.

**Fortified:** The bearer ignores the first point of System Strain they'd otherwise incur in a day.

**Graceful:** The bearer walks so lightly as to leave no footprints and cannot slip, trip, or be subject to forced movement by a man-sized foe.

**Harmonic:** An allied mage can cast a spell on it; the bearer is then immune to that spell until it is changed.

**Impervious:** Once per round, the bearer ignores an instance of Shock they would otherwise have suffered.

**Inspiring:** Allies who can see the wearer gain a +1 Morale bonus and may reroll failed Mental saves against emotion or thought-controlling effects.

**Lucky:** Once per day, as an Instant action, turn a failed save into a success.

**Majestic:** Its magnificent appearance makes it socially acceptable wear in any situation or context.

**Sealed:** The bearer ignores toxic atmospheres, terrestrial temperature extremes, and has no need to breathe.

**Shifting:** The bearer can teleport up to 30' to a visible location as a Move action.

**Shining:** It can emit light in a 30' radius at will. Once per day as an On Turn action, force a melee foe to make a Physical save or lose their next Main Action from being dazzled.

**Silent:** It applies no penalty to Sneak skill checks. If light armor or a shield, it grants a +1 bonus to the checks.

**Soaring:** As a Main Action, the bearer can move twice their movement rate through the air. They'll fall if they end the turn on an unsupported surface.

**Sustaining:** Once per day, cause the bearer to gain a point of System Strain and lose all need for sleep, food, air, or drink for the next 24 hours.

**Thorned:** Successful grapple, unarmed or natural weapon attacks against them also inflict 1d6 damage on the attacker, plus any armor enhancement bonus.

**Transient:** It can vanish from its wearer or return to their person as an On Turn action once per round. It appears if they fall unconscious or die.

**Unsleeping:** The bearer need not sleep, but will not get the benefits of a night's rest unless they do so.

**Vigilant:** The bearer can see normally even in deep mists or total darkness. They cannot be surprised.

**Warded:** The GM chooses one weapon entry from the table on page 37. Non-magic weapons of that kind can't hurt the bearer, and magic ones do only half damage, rounded down. Neither inflicts Shock.

**Weightless:** It has no Encumbrance, but this benefit does not apply to the Armored Magic Focus' limits or the armor's usual skill check penalties.

## Magical Armor Creation Costs

Crafting magical armor or shields is usually an expensive, complex process. The demands of forging powerful armor are often too great for ordinary mages of the modern day, and they might need to seek out special ingredients or particular lost tomes to lower the base difficulty.

The base creation difficulty for +1 armor is difficulty 10 and requires 25,000 silver and a masterwork suit of armor to enchant. Each additional +1 bonus adds +2 difficulty and doubles the price, up to a maximum of +3.

Adding a minor special ability with a narrowly-applicable effect to a shield or suit of armor costs 10,000 silver and adds +1 to the difficulty. Broadly-applicable or potent special abilities add +2 to the difficulty and cost 20,000 silver. If enchanting a shield, the difficulty additions of its special abilities are added to 9, so a shield with one minor and one major power would cost 30,000 silver to forge and a difficulty 12 skill check.
