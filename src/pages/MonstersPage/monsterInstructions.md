# Monster Generation Guide

## Monster Shapes and Appearances

If you don't already have a clear idea of what your monster should look like, these tables can offer some suggestions.

### Generation Process

1. **First**, find out what animal it most resembles. If you need to fill in details of the creature's appearance, use this as a baseline default.

2. **Next**, roll or choose its basic body plan. Intelligent creatures usually have some manipulatory appendages, but they don't necessarily have to be bipedal.

3. **Then**, figure out how the creature hunts in its natural habitat, if it's not intelligent and thus capable of farming or herding its prey. For monstrous creatures, you might also roll or pick to find out why it hasn't denuded its surroundings of food and starved to death yet, or why it hasn't destroyed the local ecology with its depredations.

4. **Lastly**, you can spice this basic plan up with rolls or picks from the characteristic body part table below. Feel free to mix in insectile parts on a basically serpentine creature, or blend in exotic elements into a conventional mammal. Between Outsider interference and the caprice of sorcerer-kings, all manner of forms are possible.

## Monstrous Drives

What makes a creature monstrous is not necessarily what it is, but what it does. Something about the creature's behavior or wants is anathema to human interests, and its activities bring misery, suffering, and death to the people around it.

It may be that your "monster" isn't particularly dangerous to humanity. It may just be an odd creature that exists in a particular environment, of no special danger to humans who don't get in its way. There's a great deal of fun in creating strange beasts for a campaign world, and there's nothing wrong with making the occasional creature like this.

Even so, the usual point of making monsters for a game is to make problems for the players. Ravaging beasts, hideous raiders, sinister and insidious threats from withinâ€¦ these sort of creatures spark the conflicts, problems, and complications that make for usable adventure grist.

The table below gives twelve different kinds of malevolent drives that might motivate the creature. Bestial entities might not be capable of pursuing the more intellectual forms of evil listed there, but intelligent monsters will carry out their purpose with every ounce of wit they have. Monsters usually have some magical or unnatural power useful in fulfilling their drive.

When choosing a drive, it's important to tie it back to the creature's origins and nature. Beasts formed or warped by the Outsiders might have any kind of malevolent purpose, having had it impressed upon their psyche by their embittered alien creators. Entities forged by other groups or by the whim of nature will likely have drives related to that group's purposes or the circumstances of the natural accident that created its kind.

### Monstrous Drives (d12)

| d12 | Drive | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 1   | **Conquest** | It needs to destroy all rivals and interlopers within its territory, which must expand with the creature's increasing might. This may be a very literal form of conquest, with the beast seeking to kill any intruder within its realm and probing outward constantly to seek new land. It may also be social or metaphorical, with the creature seeking to become the exclusive power within a social sphere, profession, guild, or skein of relationships. |
| 2   | **Construction** | It has to build something that can cause problems for humans. It might be driven to create elaborate nests, forced to foment treacherous schemes against humanity, made to build large civil structures in awkward places, manufacture a particular sort of good beyond all need, generate a toxin or miasma, xenoform terrain to fit its alien creator's home world, or some other act of troublesome creation. |
| 3   | **Consumption** | It needs to eat something that is either difficult to acquire, greatly troublesome to humanity, or magical or metaphorical in nature. It might consume loving relationships, eat youth, dine exclusively on traitors, be impossibly gluttonous, devour magical items, or need special alchemical mixes. |
| 4   | **Deception** | It must feign some harmless or innocent guise, fitting in perfectly as its adopted role. Animals may seem to be some different, more docile creature, while intelligent beings may masquerade as humans or adopt some specific social role. It must kill whatever it would replace, and destroy anything or anyone that might threaten to reveal the truth about it, showing the reality of its nature only when it feeds or enjoys the benefits of the role it has adopted. |
| 5   | **Defilement** | It must degrade and destroy those things that give hope or meaning to humanity. Corrupting religions, poisoning food crops, curdling familial love, inducing leaders to become tyrants, and withering bonds of loyalty might all be tools for such creatures. Most of them will have a particular type of good thing that their powers and nature enable them to debauch. |
| 6   | **Destruction** | It must destroy something that is useful or necessary to humans. It might blindly slaughter livestock beyond all hunting need, instinctively seek the destruction of man-made edifices, have an inherent compulsion to destroy loving relationships, eat metal tools and weapons, consume the health and luck of its prey, or otherwise take away something that humans need. |
| 7   | **Domination** | It needs to win the slavish submission of its chosen prey. Rather than killing them, they must be reduced to helpless obedience to the creature's needs and wishes. Animals may terrorize sentients until worship or tribute is offered, while intelligent beings might use social tools or threats to force compliance. Weaker creatures of its own kind might be treated with similar brutality. |
| 8   | **Parasitization** | It has to subvert and suborn humanity or something humans rely upon. This may be a physical act of parasitization on a human host, or it may be a more metaphorical leech, taking advantage of some quality of human society to feed and shelter it. Parasitized hosts may be hollowed-out skinsuits, helplessly enslaved victims, willing but foolish co-conspirators, unwitting cattle, or humans who can provide some special service or quality the creature craves. |
| 9   | **Predation** | There's something that it absolutely must hunt or kill, and pursuing them is a need at an instinctive level. This is usually something problematic for humans, such as a compulsion to hunt humans, specific types of people, livestock, particular demihumans, people who have committed a particular type of act, those who trespass on its territory, or some other type of victim. |
| 10  | **Reproduction** | It has some unique or difficult condition for reproduction that it must satisfy, such as needing large amounts of a particular substance, a properly-built nest, a difficult-to-win mate, a helpless parasitized host, the brutal conquest of its rivals, or even some magical or esoterically metaphorical condition. This condition causes problems for humanity around it. |
| 11  | **Sadism** | It was created not necessarily to kill its prey, but to torment it. Terrifying taunts, senseless cruelty, and abominably awful methods of harm are employed instinctively by this creature, and it will always prefer to leave its prey alive until every ounce of resistance has been wrung from it. It receives great delight from the suffering of others. |
| 12  | **Theft** | It has a compulsion to steal something that humans need in order to hoard or use it itself. It may compulsively steal and collect gold and other shiny objects, plunder food, carry off large amounts of some socially-necessary good, or have magical means to take away intangible qualities or social relationships. It should often be possible to recover the lost traits if the creature is subdued. |

## Uncanny Powers and Abilities

A basic stat line for a creature can make it a challenge in combat, but foes who can do nothing but stab, bite, claw, or shoot can become a little stale in play. More significantly, the unusual powers a creature possesses can often be the very things that make it an interesting element of a situation, allowing it to change the environment or shift the circumstances in ways that the PCs may not be equipped to handle.

### Power Guidelines

For a GM, there are two classes of powers to keep in mind when building a creature:

- **Combat powers** are those abilities that are likely to come out in a fight, the special abilities and unique martial talents that might make the creature an unusual handful during a clash.
- **Situational powers** are less combat-specific abilities that are still likely to play a role in how the creature acts or how it carries out its ambitions.

### Building Creature Powers

1. **First**, pick a power that will let them pursue their drive or demonstrate their nature. This power should be very characteristic to the creature or NPC.

2. **Second**, pick another power that fits the creature's idiom or purpose. If the initial power you chose was a combat power, pick a situational one, or vice-versa.

3. **Third**, decide whether or not you need this creature to be a major combat foe. If you foresee a fight with this thing being a major event in an evening's play, you may wish to add one or two more combat powers to its selection.

### Creature Power Levels

| Point Total | The Creature's Degree of Power |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| 0           | Perfectly ordinary beast or person |
| 2           | Minor hero or significant mage |
| 3           | Minor magical beast or construct |
| 4           | Species of magically-potent sentient |
| 5           | Significant magical beast or being |
| 6           | Major hero or famous mage |
| 8           | Hero of a magically-potent species |
| 8           | Regionally-significant magical beast |
| 10          | Legendary magical beast |
| 10          | Legate or famous major hero |
| 15          | Imperator or other demi-divine being |

---

### Damage Infliction Powers

The creature hurls bolts of energy, wields eldritch forces, or has a remarkably unpleasant bite. As a Main Action, it can target one or more foes with some power that inflicts direct damage.

| Points | Damage Infliction |
|--------|-------------------|
| 1      | A power does damage equal to a normal weapon blow |
| 2      | A power does damage of about 3d6 |
| 3      | A power does damage of about 6d6 |
| 5      | A power does damage of 10d6 or more |
| -1     | The power only works in melee range |
| -1     | The power's damage allows a save for half |
| x1/2   | The power's damage allows a save for none |
| x2     | The power's damage is done to multiple targets |
| x2     | The power's damage is ongoing, repeating in full or part for several rounds |
| -1     | The power's damage requires a hit roll |
| 2      | The power can be used once per round as an On Turn action |

---

### Movement Powers

The creature has a special movement ability uncommon to its nature. Any ordinary animal might have a movement rate of 40' per Move, or even 60', but this creature has a degree of speed or supernatural agility that is remarkable for something of its kind.

| Points | Movement Powers |
|--------|-----------------|
| 2      | Flight ability at its movement rate, including the ability to fight on the wing |
| 2      | Passes through any solid object |
| 1      | Ignores a type of solid barrier substance |
| 2      | Extra Move action each round |
| 1      | Movement increased by 50% |
| 1      | It makes Fighting Withdrawals as On Turn actions |
| 1      | Can leap its full movement rate |
| 1      | Can swim, climb, or navigate some other usually-troublesome medium at full speed |
| 2      | It can teleport at its movement rate |
| 2      | Can teleport long distances through shadows, flame, or other characteristic substances |
| 1      | Gets a free Instant Move action when some characteristic event or circumstance obtains |
| 1      | It can split its Move action's movement around its Main Action |

---

### Debilitating Powers

The creature has some power to debuff or neutralize its enemies. While it's possible to just give a creature the power to apply a numeric penalty to people, it's often more interesting to give it the ability to cripple particular types of action or create serious trade-offs in employing common maneuvers.

| Points | Debilitating Power |
|--------|-------------------|
| 1      | Melee or ranged attacks must be rolled twice and the worst hit and damage used |
| 1      | Lose a Move action for the round |
| 3      | Suffer paralysis, unconsciousness, or other fight-ending status after being hit twice with this ability. 5 points if only one hit is needed. |
| 2      | Suffer 1d6 damage/2 HD of the creature when you do a common type of activity |
| 2      | Lose a Main action for the round |
| 2      | Become unable to cast spells or use arts for 1d4 rounds |
| 1      | Suffer double damage from the creature |
| +1     | The power applies a -2 penalty to any saves against it |
| x3     | The power automatically affects all foes around it, with a save to resist |
| x2     | The penalty lasts longer than just the scene |
| x1/2   | The power is only usable 1-3 times a fight |
| x2     | Use the power as an On Turn action once per round |

---

### Augmenting Powers

Just as some creatures can debuff their foes, others can boost their own abilities or the abilities of their allies. It's important that the boost be tied to some particular situation or thematic quality rather than just being a short-duration bonus the thing triggers at the start of the fight.

| Points | Augmenting Power |
|--------|------------------|
| 1      | Gain an extra normal attack |
| 1      | Double an attack's normal damage or Shock |
| 2      | Gain a bonus Main Action |
| 1      | Regenerate its HD in lost hit points each round until you're slain |
| 1      | Gain a +4 bonus to AC or become immune to Shock |
| 2      | One attack per round becomes unavoidable |
| 1      | Become immune to certain general types of spells and magical effects |
| 3      | Gain an entire bonus round of action |
| 2      | Automatically succeed at one save per round |
| +0     | The buff trigger lasts only a short while or is difficult to arrange |
| +1     | The buff trigger either lasts a long while once achieved or is not hard to make happen |
| -1     | The creature has to work continuously to maintain or obtain the trigger situation |
| x2     | The buff is normally in effect, either because it's intrinsic or very easy to trigger |

---

### Intrinsic Powers

Some monsters simply have a number of special abilities by virtue of what they are. These special powers usually are applied as Main Actions, though some of them trigger automatically when they are hit or when they hit a target.

| Points | Intrinsic Power |
|--------|-----------------|
| 2      | Use a first or second-level spell equivalent |
| 4      | Use a third or fourth-level spell equivalent |
| 6      | Use a fifth level spell equivalent |
| x2     | Use a given spell equivalent at will |
| x1/2   | Use a given spell equivalent only when the situation is thematically appropriate or a specific trigger situation applies |
| +1     | Use the spell equivalent as an On Turn action at most once per round |
| 1      | Use a Mage art equivalent once a scene |
| 2      | Use a Mage art equivalent at will |
| 1      | Gain the benefits of one level of a Focus |
| 2      | Be immune to a general class of weapon: piercing, slashing, crushing, or the like |
| 3      | Be immune to non-magical weapons |
| 6      | Require a specific type of weapon or form of injury to harm it |
| 1      | Be immune to an uncommon harm like poison, frost, or electricity |
| 2      | Be immune to a fairly common harm like fire or mind-affecting magic |
| 3      | Be immune to an entire large class of material, such as metal, plant matter, or directly damaging spells |
| 1+     | Inflict a particular debuff or damage on someone who hits you with a save to avoid it; add the harmful power's cost to this |
